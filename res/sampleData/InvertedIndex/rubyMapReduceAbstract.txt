The crown jewel of Starfish is actually a library built on Starfish called MapReduce. Inspired by Google's MapReduce (en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MapReduce), it automates the process of divide and conquer for large data sets. Currently, Starfish's implementation only works with the ActiveRecord ORM from Ruby on Rails. The idea is that you have a very large data set that would be unmanageable to process otherwise. For example, let's say your database table has 30GB of information in it. It would be very difficult to keep 30GB of records in RAM at one time; even if you processed them serially, it would take a very long time. The idea is to have many clients grabbing chunks of the database at a time making much faster work, even on a single processor machine, than would otherwise be feasible.
