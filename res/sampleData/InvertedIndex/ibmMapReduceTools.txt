What is IBM MapReduce Tools for Eclipse?

IBM MapReduce Tools for Eclipse is a plug-in that supports the creation of MapReduce applications within Eclipse. It uses the Hadoop open-source MapReduce framework, which enables data-intensive applications to run on large clusters of commodity hardware.

The plug-in supports the following features from within Eclipse:

    * the ability to package and deploy a Java project as a JAR (Java Archive) file to a Hadoop server (local and remote)
    * cheat sheets that assist with the development process
    * a separate perspective with a view of Hadoop servers, the Hadoop distributed file system (DFS), and current job status
    * wizards for facilitating the development of classes based on the MapReduce framework.

This plug-in runs on Windows, Linux, or any system that can run Eclipse.

How does it work?
The plug-in automatically creates projects with the Hadoop libraries for development and testing. Templates for MapReduce drivers are also provided. After a project is completed, the plug-in uses SCP (secure copy) to deploy the code to a Hadoop server and then remotely executes it via SSH (secure shell). During execution, the plug-in communicates with the Hadoop task tracker via HTTP and displays the job status.
